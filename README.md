# portfolio

In this project, I created my own personal portolio showcasing my new skills that I have learned through Codeacademy.
The  main page of my portfolio features different projects that I have built through my coursework and contains some very basic
contact information.
I built this website using HTML, CSS and incorporated a Javascript interactive feature.
